  <h3 class="page-section-subheader">Teacher Salaries</h3>

  <section class="page-prose">
    <p>This measure is calculated by taking the total pay for teachers within each group and dividing that figure by the total teacher full-time equivalent (FTE) count for the group. The total actual salary amount is pay for regular duties only and does not include supplemental pay. For teachers who also have nonteaching roles, only the portion of time and pay dedicated to classroom responsibilities is factored into this calculation.</p>
